=== Configuration File

The following shows an example of a configuration file that can be passed to the command.

[source,yaml]
----
project:
- name: tigerfest
  framework:
    type: dotnet
    option: webapi
    version: latest
  platform:
    type: aks    
  sourcecontrol:
    type: github
    url: https://github.com/russellseymour/my-new-project.git

pipeline: azdo

cloud:
  platform: azure
  region: ukwest
  group: a-new-resource-group

business:
  company: MyCompany
  domain: core
  component: infra

terraform:
  backend:
    storage: adfsdafsdfsdf
    group: Stacks-Ancillary-Resources
    container: tfstate

network:
  base:
    domain: mydomain.com

stacks:
  dotnet:
    webapi: https://github.com/amido/stacks-dotnet
----

Note that when using the configuration file it is possible to specify multiple projects to be configured. This allows several projects to be setup at the same time, without having to run the command multiple times. Each project will be created within the specified working directory.

If this file was called `conf.yml` the command to run to consume the file would be:

[source,bash]
----
.\stacks-cli.exe scaffold -c .\local\conf.yml
