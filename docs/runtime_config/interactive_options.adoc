==== Interactive Options

As the configuration file for the CLI can seem a bit daunting it has an interactive mode which will prompt for answers to questions about how projects are to be configured.

After the command has been run the resultant configuration file can be run with the `scaffold` command.

There are no additional options to be specified for the interactive command over and above the global options.
